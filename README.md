# unity_AR_base
Simple starting point for AR apps

This project uses AR Foundation, and is built off their samples for initial setup.  
So it is recommended to use Unity 2019.3.3f1.

## Setup
* Once Unity is installed, create a new 3D project, name whatever you want, open it and switch it over to an Android platform in Build Settings.
* Download this repo, and then copy it right overtop of your new project and replace the files.
